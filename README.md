2. **FFmpeg** - Required for audio conversion

### Installing FFmpeg

#### macOS (using Homebrew):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### Windows:

1. Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Extract and add to your PATH environment variable

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/ringtonewala-flask
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. Paste a YouTube video URL into the input field

4. Click "Convert to Audio" and wait for the conversion to complete

5. Click "Download MP3" to save the audio file to your device

## How It Works

1. **Input**: User provides a YouTube video URL
2. **Processing**: The application uses yt-dlp to download the video and FFmpeg to extract audio
3. **Conversion**: Video is converted to high-quality MP3 format (192 kbps)
4. **Download**: User can download the converted audio file

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Video Processing**: yt-dlp (YouTube downloader)
- **Audio Conversion**: FFmpeg (via yt-dlp)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS
- **Temporary Storage**: Files are stored in system temp directory

## File Structure

```

## Security Notes

- The application uses temporary files that are automatically cleaned up
- Files are stored in the system's temporary directory
- Consider implementing file cleanup for production use
- Change the secret key in production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **FFmpeg not found**: Make sure FFmpeg is installed and in your PATH
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure the application has write access to the temp directory
3. **Conversion fails**: Check if the YouTube URL is valid and accessible

### Error Messages:

- "Error converting video": Usually indicates an invalid URL or network issue
- "File not found": Temporary file was not created properly
- "Audio file was not created properly": FFmpeg conversion failed
